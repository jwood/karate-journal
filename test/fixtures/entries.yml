    == Basics
    We worked on the fumikomi from Bassai.
    <lfrag ids="Bassai, Fumikomi">Mr. Ohshima said fumikomi should have a very strong feeling.</lfrag>
    We also worked on oi-zuki.  <lfrag ids="Oi-Zuki">Mr. Ohshima stressed that we should not
    move our front foot before making the punch.</lfrag>  We then did a bunch of oi-zuki.
    <lfrag ids="Oi-Zuki">Mr. Ohshima stressed the importance of making oi-zuki in one movement.</lfrag>

    == Kata
    Towards the end of practice we spent some time working on Heian Shodan.

    <bfrag ids="Heian Shodan">
    === Heian Shodan
    * In the first movement, hips go in without hesitation.  They are already open,
    so just go!
    * Don't move before you can "feel" your opponent.
    * When "blocking" up the middle, feel as if you are attacking your opponent with
    your elbow.
